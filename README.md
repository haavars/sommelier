# Sommelier

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies. This will run the seeds file and add data to the database.
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Navigate to /search and enter a search string.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
